// 25. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
// variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
// a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
// fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

let aliean_color : string = "green";
if(aliean_color==="green"){
console.log("player Just earned 5 Point!");
}
else{
    console.log("The Version that fails will have no output");
